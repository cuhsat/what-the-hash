# What the hash!?

Have you ever stumbled upon a hash and didn't know what for? Me too, buddy. So I created this simple program one Saturday evening, that we might wonder no more!

**What the hash** a simple hash reverse lookup. It searches a database of [270+](https://github.com/s0md3v/Bolt/blob/master/db/hashes.json) hash algorithms for the possible source of the given hash sum and outputs all found matches in [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) notation.

```sh
$ wth HASHSUM
```
